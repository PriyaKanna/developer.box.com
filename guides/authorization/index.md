# Authorization

Some applications require explicit Admin authorization before use with an
enterprise. The steps an Admin needs to take are dependent on the
developer-selected authentication method and enabled enterprise settings.

## Authentication Methods

The following authentication methods always require explicit Admin
authorization:

- Server Authentication (with JWT)
- Server Authentication (with Client Credentials Grant)
- App Token Authentication
- Custom Skill 

These authentication methods automatically generate a [Service Account][sa].
With the right [scopes][scopes] enabled, a Service Account can perform many
Admin actions, thus requiring Admin authorization before use.

## Enterprise Settings

Subsequent steps are required if either of the following enterprise settings are
enabled:

- Disable published applications by default
- Disable unpublished application by default

These [settings][setting] can be found by navigating to:

**Admin Console** > **Apps** > **Custom Apps** > click the âš™ icon

## Scenarios

To see what steps an Admin must complete for a given app, review the following
scenarios.
